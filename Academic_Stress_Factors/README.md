# Academic Stress Factors Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset from Kaggle exploring the relationship between academic and lifestyle factors and student stress levels.

## Highlights
- Cleaned and prepared dataset (removed duplicates)
- Explored distributions and correlations
- Found that study load has the strongest relationship with stress (r = 0.39)
- Visualized patterns with heatmaps, bar plots, and box plots

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scipy (for correlation & p-values)

## Results
Heavy study load is the most consistent predictor of stress levels among students.
