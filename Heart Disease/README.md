# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

## 1. Project Overview

This project explores the UCI Heart Disease dataset to understand the factors that contribute to heart disease and to build predictive machine-learning models that can identify patients at higher risk.
The goal is to walk through a full end-to-end data science workflow — from exploration to modeling and interpretation — while keeping the analysis understandable and clinically meaningful.

This project highlights how data can support early detection of heart disease and provides a practical example of applying machine-learning techniques to a real medical dataset.
